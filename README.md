# Asset-Managment-System

## Project Overview
In order to manage CARO Analytical System investment and provide strategies and tools to help maintain the company assets we build a new 
Asset Management System to keep information on its tangible and intangible assets with the ability to manage that data. 

We build a web-based application that will help the user to interact with a friendly user interface to fulfill client specified functions 
such as ADDING, DELETING, or MODIFYING an asset, generating reports, data importing capabilities, perform backup and restore data and more.
